This bug occurs when using the Expo CLI to build an Android APK.  The build process fails with an error similar to `Execution failed for task ':app:processDebugGoogleServices`.  The error message often points to a problem with the `google-services.json` file, but the file is correctly placed and formatted. The problem is actually a mismatch between the package name in the `google-services.json` file and the package name declared in the `android/app/build.gradle` file.
